# Corpus

> **Kraken Air (XX) and Wyvern Overseas Airways (YY) are fictional.** Nothing in this folder is
> real airline data: no real airline system, customer or production data is used anywhere. All 49
> documents across the two editions end with the line `Kraken Air is a fictional carrier. This
> document is synthetic training material.`

The synthetic Kraken Air corpus, in two editions:

- `2026-Q2/` — 21 documents, the edition the fine-tuned model was trained on
- `2026-Q3/` — 28 documents, the fresh edition RAG serves

`2026-Q2/` is generated, never hand-edited. `python scripts/make_q2.py` derives it from
`2026-Q3/` and writes `DELTA.md` in the same pass, so the delta between the editions is the
script's output rather than a claim about it. Edit `2026-Q3/`, then regenerate.

## Contradictions that are deliberate

The corpus contains documents that disagree with each other. That is the point: a real rule
book contradicts itself, and retrieval that only works on a consistent corpus does not
transfer. Each disagreement below is placed on purpose. Anything else in the corpus that
contradicts itself is a defect, not a lesson.

| Where | The disagreement | What uses it |
|---|---|---|
| `sop_misconnect_v3.md` against `sop_misconnect_v4.md` | Both carry `Document ID: OPS-SOP-MISCONNECT` and both sit in `2026-Q3/`. v3 is `Version: 3 \| Superseded` and puts the meal voucher at EUR 10 with an 8-hour hotel threshold; v4 is `Version: 4 \| Current`, EUR 15, 6 hours. The version line is the only line that separates them, which is what makes the pair hard for a retriever. | Modules 4, 5 and 10; gold question q05 |
| `bulletin_scb_2026_0902.md` against `bulletin_scb_2026_0925.md` | 0902 publishes 07:45 for XX 2201 and is stamped `STATUS: Superseded — see SCB-2026-0925`; 0925 publishes 07:20 and says the 07:45 time is withdrawn. | Gold question q17 |
| `bulletin_scb_2026_0921.md` against `bulletin_scb_2026_0930.md` | 0921 publishes 15:40 for XX 3310 and is stamped `STATUS: Superseded — see SCB-2026-0930`; 0930 publishes 16:25. q18's query names no bulletin id, only the withdrawn time, which both documents contain. | Gold question q18 |
| `faq_en_general.md` Q6 | Cites SCB-2026-0902 as the reference for XX 2201 — the bulletin since withdrawn — and warns in the next sentence that a later bulletin supersedes an earlier one. A stale cross-reference carrying its own correction. | Distractor for q17 |
| `codeshare_xx_yy_conditions.md` 3.1–3.3 | On one codeshare sector the operating carrier's SOP decides the care and the marketing carrier's fare rules decide the penalty. 3.2 states the consequence plainly and calls it intended rather than a filing error. | Gold question q08 |
| `policy_corporate_travel.md` 4.1 against the CLASSIC fare sheets | The internal travel policy grants a free same-day change that the filed fare rule does not. The corpus declares this itself at `codeshare_xx_yy_conditions.md` 4.1(d) and 4.2: an internal policy is not a filed tariff, and the discrepancy is escalated rather than settled at the counter. | No module and no gold question yet |
| Export artefacts | Page numbers stranded mid-document, duplicated page footers, one duplicated paragraph in `macro_en_refund.md`, leftover HTML (`<br>`, `&nbsp;`, `<div>`), and spelling errors left as typed. `faq_en_general.md` line 4 states the convention: "Exported from legacy CRM 2026-07-02. Artefacts may remain." | Module 7 — `strip_boilerplate()` in `eval/chunking.py` removes 4.2% of the characters |

RULE 7 in `fare_classic_shorthaul.md` and `fare_classic_longhaul.md` is the opposite case: not a
contradiction but the rule that settles one. On a mixed-band itinerary the sheet follows the
transaction rather than the document, so a voluntary change to a single coupon is priced on the
band of the Kraken sector held and a cancellation of the journey as a whole on the long-haul
sheet. Without it, gold questions q19 and q20 are the same itinerary shape scored against two
different sheets.

## What is not deliberate

Outside that list the corpus is meant to be consistent, and these properties are checked rather
than assumed:

- Every fare sheet's prose agrees with its own table, including the baggage column in
  `fare_classic_shorthaul.md` and the doubled no-show amounts in every CLASSIC row.
- Every `Supersedes:` chain steps back exactly one edition, in the quarter and in the sequence
  number. `scripts/make_q2.py` derives the Q2 identifiers from those lines and fails loudly if a
  Q3 stamp survives into the Q2 folder.
- Every cross-reference resolves to the section it names (`HR-TRV-06` section 4.4 for the lounge
  rule, `HR-TRV-04` section 5.1 for the cancellation credit, `HR-TRV-04` section 4.1 for the
  same-day change).
- Nothing in `2026-Q3/` is issued after the training day, 7 October 2026. The latest `ISSUED:`
  line is 2026-09-30. The 2026-10-25 dates are effective dates for the W26 winter season,
  published in advance, which is what a schedule change bulletin does.
